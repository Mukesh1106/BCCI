                    Virat Kohli had a dream. A dream like every other young kid in India to represent the country in the
                    gentleman’s game. It is this vigor and fervor for the game of cricket that has helped this extremely
                    talented young boy from Delhi to scale great heights at a very young age. He was barely in his teens
                    when he led the India Under-19 team to a World Cup victory in Kuala Lumpur in 2008 which was a
                    pointer
                    of bigger and better things to come in the future. After that famous victory, it was not long before
                    he
                    made his entry into the senior team and Kohli was soon brushing shoulders with the best in the
                    business
                    and his cricketing idol Sachin Tendulkar.

                    Popularly known as the Hitman for his hard hitting skills, Rohit Sharma is a gifted batsman and an
                    immensely talented cricketer who is pleasing on the eye with his elegance and ability to time the
                    ball. Each time Rohit Sharma walks out to bat, the word “talent” features more often than not
                    amongst his fans and the cricketing circles. Rohit Sharma got off to a good start in his
                    international career with crucial contributions in the T20 World Cup in 2007 and the CB Series in
                    Australia. He almost made his Test debut in 2010 against South Africa but he injured himself on the
                    morning of the Test match; Rohit would then have to wait for three more years to finally represent
                    India in whites. Rohit continued to take giant strides in the shortest format of the game and
                    attracted a lot of attention by achieving success in the IPL. He also led the Mumbai Indians to
                    their maiden IPL title in 2013.

                    He was termed as “The Rockstar” by Shane Warne when Ravindra Jadeja took the Indian Premier League
                    by storm in 2008 with his all-round heroics. An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm
                    spinner and a fearless batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer. Though
                    predominantly known for his performances for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, not many notice his
                    efforts in the longer format of the game. The left-handed batsman has three triple centuries to his
                    name with a first-class average close to 50. He paved his way to the national side amassing 739 runs
                    and 42 wickets in the 2008-09 Ranji season. He made his ODI debut in 2009 against Sri Lanka and has
                    been a key player in the Indian since.It took him three more years after his ODI debut to make it
                    into the Test side and India now see him as a good variety in the bowling attack and more than a
                    handy bat lower down the order. International cricket aside, Jadeja has also been a vital cog in the
                    wheel for his IPL franchise - Chennai Super Kings.
